    - This could vary system to system however, if you installed ULTRAKILL through steam, you could do, `ULTRAKILL > Manage > Manage > Browse Local Files` to find your game directory.

3. From the downloaded `.pitr` file(s), drag the file into the above mentioned directory and save.
    - Virutorture 2 should be playable by sandbox now thus finishing the installation.
